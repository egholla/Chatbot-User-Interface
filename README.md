# Chatbot-User-Interface
Fully functional chat user interface made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Featuring real-time message input and scrollable chat history.

This project is just an interface for interacting with a chatbot through API calls, I thought it would be good experience working with front-end and javascript. Admittedly it is not perfect as far as aesthetics go but it definitely gets the job done and doesn't break, to my knowledge. 

The only thing you need to know to use it is that I used the live server extension to display the webpage that contains the chatbot, and that you will need your own apiKey. I used a text generation API key from eden AI.

To use the API key with my code you simply need to copy and paste it on line 9 where it says apiKey = "APIKEYHERE"; and again on line 64 where it says "Authorization": "Bearer APIKEYHERE", after doing those things it should work.

Apologies if this is not the most straightforward, but hopefully things run smoothly, Thanks!
